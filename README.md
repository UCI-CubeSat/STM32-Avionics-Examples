# STM32-Avionics-Examples
### Repository Overview
STM32L4 (CFC) and STM32F4 (ADCS) implementations of basic functinalities or complex functionalities for practiicng and development purposes.
### How to Save Code to the Repo
Since the code is meant for specific platforms and you may have multiple files for an implementation please attempt to follow these standards for uploading your code to the repository.
#### Storing Files
Please store your files including configuration and library dependencies from the stm32 IDE that are generated in a single folder within the repository. For example if you create a program blink.c then you should make a folder and store all the IDE generated code and source files in their and keep it isolated from other files to not cause conflicts. This process may change in the future.
#### Branching
Please branch when you start a new project and don't dirrectly push to master but submit a pull request first to merge your changes.
